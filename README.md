About
This is the official MP4 Converter  using Wails.


Building
Use wails build to create a distributable, production-ready package. Note: You must set the ffmpeg path in the program path line 254  or include the ffmpeg package within your project, as it cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to its size. Ensure ffmpeg is correctly packaged with your project to handle MP4 conversions.
